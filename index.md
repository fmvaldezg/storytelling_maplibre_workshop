### Goal of this workshop

Our goal is to show you how to create your own interactive storytelling applications with maps and multimedia, using open source tools. We will show some examples of stories and get hands-on with how to create your own interactive applications and share them on the web. 

This tutorial is designed so that you will be able to create an interactive story without any coding knowledge, however, if this is your first time generating code it may take you some time to get familiar with these types of interfaces and files, although it won't be complicated. 

If you want to familiarize yourself with the use of code for this type of activities, we recommend you to check the additional resources section.
