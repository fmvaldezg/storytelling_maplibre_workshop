## Deploy your story map as a web page

Now that your story map is finished, it is time to deploy it as a web page. For that we will use `GitHub pages`.

[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

To publish your map as a web page follow this steps:

Step 1
{: .label .label-step}

Go to `GitHub` cloud and sign in to your account.

You can click on the `View on GitHub` button on your `GitHub Desktop app` to open the repository on your browser.

If you did not before, you will have to make your repository `public` in order to use GitHub pages.

Simply click on the `General` button on the panel on the left.

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on `Change visibility` and then on `Change to public`.
